# TOD-Decomp
Tower of Druaga Decomp using PPC. 

WE DON'T PROVIDE ANY ASSETS!!!!!!!!!!!!

[PPC]() is a Game Cube transcompiler for Power PC to C++.

# Project Structure

- Raw ASM || This name is kinda lie. As this assembly is generated by [DTK] as that's step 1 in the recomp process. But it's had names changed via type info generated by PPC.
In a full recomp project you are not required to keep the assembly, or generate it's type info.

- Recomp || This is the outputed C/C++ generated as the end product.

- GCRuntime || This is the [PPC GC Runtime]() used to to compile the Static Recomp for Desktop.

# Build
To build the static recomp. You will need a base ROM of Tower of Druga. We can not provide one. Once you have it, extract it's contents into the `Recomp/Assets` folder.

Then double click `GenProject.bat`. This will use Premake5 to generate a Visual Studio 2022 project. You can build it in any of the configureation. The final exe, along with assets. Will be in bin/Dist.

The final exe will be called `TOD.exe`
